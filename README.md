This is a simple project to try and recreate Google's homepage using recently learnt HTML and CSS skills. This is from The Odin Project's [curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css)

TODO:

Make the footer and bottom-nav-bar stick to the bottom of the page. Move the text box for the search bar to within the space. Move the languages options to be in line with "Google offered in: ". Fix the alignment for the top nav bar.
